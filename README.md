## Solution

I am currently working on this project, I have built the first page. I am using the Next JS framework in order to make this site SEO-friendly. It will help me to generate a static site on the build time so that I can host this on a CDN provider. It will be super fast because the server only returns the HTML file to the clients. Next JS comes also with image optimization out of the box so all images of the website will be optimized. I am using "Sass" for styling because it gives CSS superpower, also customizable for any type of design. The website has a light background and dark mode switch option so that users can easily read and don't get hurt in their eyes.
